                To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his career, is like saying it snows in
                Alaska; a bit of an understatement. He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to Festival Director
                —some of his best known avatars — with amazing fluidity.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital Design. A year later and for reasons
                that scientists are still trying to understand, Nikhil joined MTV. He said, “I think it’ll be fun.” For
                once, he was right.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired. From MTV Select – MTV’s longest
                running show, (it aired continuously for 10 years) to being the host of Splitsvilla, a judge on Roadies
                as well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Nikhil’s Mom still thinks he’s an idiot though and should get a real job.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As a popular VJ, Nikhil got to spend a lot of time around his first love, music. In 2001, a conversation
                between friends resulted in the launch of Submerge — India’s first, and now largest Indian Electronic
                Dance
                Music (EDM) company in India.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                By now, Nikhil had begun to DJ professionally and plays, well… whatever he feels like. His sets are
                moody,
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
            varied, often erratic but usually fun. Most of his sets feature frantic foot-stomping and the random
            flailing of arms – sometimes by him. They also feature music – the kind that has a repetitive monotonous
            beat and is best enjoyed at dangerous decibel levels.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
            Nikhil was also the co-founder of Sunburn. He is now the Festival Curator and partner of Vh1 Supersonic,
            Goa’s brand new beach music festival.
            </p>
